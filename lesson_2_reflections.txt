What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Is created a new .git directory, that files all the repository history.
I need it so I can keap track of all the changes I've made to a set of files in a project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The stading area is a midle fild between the others two.
It apoints the files to be tracked by a commit.
