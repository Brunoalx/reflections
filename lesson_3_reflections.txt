When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to store my repository, so that I can acess it anywhere and/or I'm in a colaborative work and others need to have access to it.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The problam is that it might coflit with what your doing, if someone made commits that go in a diferent direction than you.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You use forks, to copy a repository inside GitHub, to your GitHub acount, so that you can change it whithout changes to the original.
You use clone, to copy a repository into your local machine, change it and maybe pull it back if the original was on an remote repository.
You use branches, when you want to try different aproches.
